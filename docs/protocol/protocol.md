## 3.2 Data Acquisition
The data collection methodology is divided into several components to ensure comprehensive and accurate data gathering.

### 3.2.1 Physical Traits
Physical traits are derived from the Identity Provider (IDP) if available. Future versions of the protocol may ask users directly for this information if not provided by the IDP.

### 3.2.2 Device Attributes
Device attributes are obtained using the [device_info_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/device_info_plus) Flutter package, which provides detailed information about the user's smartphone and smartwatch.

### 3.2.3 Inertial Data Collection
Inertial data is collected using the [sensors_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/sensors_plus) package. The smartphone reads its own sensor data and that of the smartwatch at specified intervals, synchronizing the streams for accurate analysis.

inertial data will respect the following right-handed coordinate system:

<p align="center"><img src="resources/omniwear-XYZ.png" width="67%" alt="omniwear coordinate system"/></p>

### 3.2.4 Health Data Collection
Health data is collected using the [health](https://pub.dev/packages/health) package, which queries health repositories such as Apple Health and Google Health Connect at specified intervals. This allows for the integration of health data from various sources into a unified dataset.

### 3.2.5 Database Config Collection
The database configuration defines the parameters for data collection, including frequencies, intervals, and the specific inertial and health features to be tracked. This configuration ensures that data is collected in a consistent and structured manner.

# 4. Data Transmission
## 4.1 Connectivity
The protocol ensures continuous connectivity between publishers (smartwatch) and subscribers (smartphone) via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This connectivity is crucial for the real-time transmission of inertial data.

## 4.2 Data Synchronization
The subscriber on the smartphone side synchronizes and reads inertial data from its own sensors and the smartwatch's sensors at specified intervals. This synchronized data is then published to the storage writer for further processing.

## 4.3 Data Transmission Protocols
The protocol uses Protocol Buffers for efficient and structured data transmission. Protocol Buffers are a method developed by Google for serializing structured data, which ensures that data transmission is both fast and reliable.

## 4.4 Publisher and Subscriber Interaction
Publishers (smartwatches) send data to subscribers (smartphones), which then forward the data to the storage writer. This interaction is managed by the OmniWear package, ensuring data integrity and synchronization.

# 5. Data Storage
## 5.1 Local On-Device Storage
Data is initially stored in an SQLite database on the device. This ensures that data is available for immediate processing and analysis, even without an internet connection.

## 5.2 Remote SQL Database Storage
For centralized data collection, data is also stored in a predefined SQL database (e.g., Firebase) via a valid connection string. The OmniWear package ensures that database migrations happen successfully to the remote database, if none exists with the desired schema.

## 5.3 Database Schema
The database schema is designed to store the collected data in a structured and efficient manner. The following tables are used:

### 5.3.7 features coding config

health and inertial features in the [Datasets Table](#532-datasets-table) follow a specific coding config logic that gives users the desired flexibility to select which features to track in the dataset:
- empty string ("") or null mean that modality is disabled and should not be collected;
- a star "*" means all features of that modality should be collected;
- a comma-separated string (e.g., "accelerometer,gyroscope" for inertial features, "STEPS,ACTIVE_ENERGY_BURNED" for health features) means that modality is enabled, but only the specified features should be collected, while the rest ignored.

The chosen features config will reflect in the TS-* tables schema.

<div class="page"/>

# 6. Data Processing and Aggregation

## 6.1 Inertial Data Aggregation
Inertial data aggregation involves transforming raw inertial data into higher-order features over specified windows. This process enhances the data's utility for various analytical purposes, including machine learning models and health insights.

## 6.2 Health Data Aggregation
Health data is aggregated by querying health repositories at specified intervals. This aggregation allows for the integration of diverse health metrics into a cohesive dataset, facilitating comprehensive health analysis.

## 6.3 ETL Pipeline
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is a critical component of the OmniWear protocol. It ensures that data is efficiently transformed into structured formats for analysis. The pipeline includes data extraction from devices, transformation into structured formats, and loading into databases for storage and analysis.

<div class="page"/>

# 7. GDPR Compliance and Data Privacy
## 7.1 Overview of GDPR Requirements
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets stringent requirements for data privacy and protection. The OmniWear protocol ensures compliance with GDPR by implementing robust data privacy measures, user consent mechanisms, and data security protocols.

## 7.2 Data Anonymization
Data is de-identified by design, ensuring that no personal identifiers are stored. This approach protects user privacy while allowing for valuable health and activity insights.

## 7.3 User Consent
Explicit user consent is obtained for data collection and processing. Users are informed about the types of data collected, the purposes of collection, and their rights regarding data access, correction, and deletion.

## 7.4 Data Security Measures
Data is encrypted during transmission and storage, ensuring that it remains secure and protected from unauthorized access. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that data security measures are effective and up-to-date.

## 7.5 Rights of Data Subjects
Users have the right to access their data, request corrections, and request deletions in accordance with GDPR regulations. These rights are communicated to users, and mechanisms are in place to facilitate these requests.
